# nsw-deploy-harvest.yml

CKAN harvester extension installation

Usage:

* Install ansible (https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
* Add the staging or production server IP to your /etc/ansible/hosts file:

        [nsw]
        XX.XX.XX.XXX

* Run the playbook:

        ansible-playbook nsw-deploy-harvest.yml -u root -s

We assume:

* A running CKAN instance installed at the default locations:
    - code at /usr/lib/ckan/{virtualenv}
    - configuration at /etc/ckan/{virtualenv}

* EPEL repository already set up


What this script does:

* Install cronie and redis packages (redis from the EPEL repository)
* Download the source and install ckanext-harvest in the virtualenv,
  including its dependencies
* Install a recent version of supervisor (http://supervisord.org/) in the
  virtualenv and copy its configuration files to /etc
* Supervisor will make sure that the two processes used by the harvesting
  (gather_consumer and fetch_consumer) are always up.
* Set up a cron job that will run the harvester command periodically
  (every 3 minutes)
* Modify the CKAN ini configuration file to add the two harvest plugins
  and extra options needed.

The script will **not** restart Apache after finishing so changes can be
manually checked.
